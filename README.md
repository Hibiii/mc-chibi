# Chibi Mod
## Hibi's Custom Mod

This mod won't be published in the near future, and isn't suggested for use in production.
Feel free to mess around with it though.

*Reality can be whatever I want.*\

## Turbo Thanks

"Thanks" can't simply describe my grattitude for these people, so a turbo thanks it is:

- supersaiyansubtlety and Reece for helping me fix missing references early on
- LlamaLad7 for helping me fix Mixin shenanigans on PlayerHurtOverride, twice

## License

This mod wouldn't have a license if not having a license wasn't a bad thing, so it's licensed under Unlicense.
